    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 ½ cups flour</li>
        <li>½ cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 cups sugar</li>
        <li>1 cup butter, softened</li>
        <li>4 large eggs</li>
        <li>1 cup sour cream</li>
        <li>½ cup milk</li>        
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Line 30 muffin cups with paper liners.</li>
        <li> Make cake: Mix together flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>Beat sugar and butter in a large bowl with an electric mixer on medium speed until light and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Beat in eggs, one at a time.</li>
        <li>Mix in sour cream, milk, food color, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Gradually beat in flour mixture on low speed until just blended; do not over-beat. Spoon batter into the prepared muffin cups, filling each 2/3 full.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until a toothpick inserted into a cupcake comes out clean, about 20 minutes. Cool in the pans on a wire rack for 5 minutes. Remove cupcakes from the pans; cool completely.</li>
        <li>While cupcakes are cooling, make frosting: Beat cream cheese, butter, sour cream, and vanilla extract in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Gradually beat in confectioners' sugar until smooth.</li>
        <li>Spread or pipe frosting onto cooled cupcakes.</li>
        
    </ol>
